Most of the ideas that are implemented were shared ideas. While working on the project, we both used to be on a meet almost always. We also wrote the report together and made equal contributions to it.



Ravi created the slideshow used in the video presentation. He did the user space profiling of the various attacks and benchmarks.


Pragyan  installed the version of the Linux kernel used in the project on his laptop and thus made most of the kernel modifications.


Overall we feel the work was evenly shared.
